Angular and ASP.Net Core app to track success at being good
It occurred to me that people were bringing in  a lot of sweets into work, and as a way of getting away from the computer for a few minutes I was always eating them.

At first I used to write down on a pen and paper which days I was eating bad food at work and which not, but then I thought I could turn this into an app, and use it as a way of playing around with the new ASP.Net Core Spa template.

To run this code you will need to download and install mongodb, which you can do from here: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community

You need .Net Core 2.2 installed to be able to run the code.

You can see a live demo of the application here:
